# PSO-Optimization

This repository contains an implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm using Python. PSO is a swarm intelligence technique inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish schools to optimize complex problems.

Features





Optimizes a simple function (e.g., ( f(x) = x^2 )).



Extensible to multi-dimensional problems.



Uses NumPy for efficient computations.

Installation





Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Mostafa-Mahmoud-H/PSO-Optimization.git



Install dependencies: pip install numpy



Run the script: python pso_example.py

Usage

Run the pso_example.py file to see the algorithm in action. Modify the fitness function to test different optimization problems.
